Great — let's now design:

🟨 Screen 3 – AI Assistant Console
🎯 Purpose
An intelligent, context-aware chat interface that allows the user to:

Ask plot-specific questions

Run compliance checks, approvals lookup, ROI queries, etc.

Interact with the AI agent layer using a conversational UX

Works as a universal interface across all stakeholder modes

🧠 1. Chat Interface Core
🗨️ Chat Window (center panel):

System prompt: “Ask me anything about this land unit (e.g., ‘Is this layout RERA-ready?’)”

Past conversation history visible (for that land unit only)

AI messages styled like advisory cards:

e.g., ✅ “This plot is within the yellow residential zone, conversion valid, but RERA not yet applied.”

📝 User Input Bar (sticky bottom):

Rich input: text + file upload

🔘 Send | 🎤 Voice Input | 🧠 Quick Prompts

💡 2. Quick Prompts (Left/Top Pane or Floating)
Dynamic based on stakeholder role. Examples:

For Layout Developer:
“Is this plot layoutable?”

“Any zoning mismatch?”

“Feasibility score breakdown?”

For Legal Advisor:
“Show EC and mutation status”

“List all legal red flags”

For Architect:
“How much land is usable after buffers?”

“Can I propose a 9m road grid?”

🔘 Tap = instantly pre-fills chat input bar.

🧾 3. Context Awareness Panel (Right Sidebar or Modal)
Shows what context is passed to the AI agent:

Land Unit ID + key attributes (zoning, conversion, EC)

Agent status: ✅ Feasibility Agent | ✅ Red Flag Agent | ⏳ Layout Suggestion Agent

This is where the Feasibility Agent shows its full power.

🧱 1. Feasibility Summary (Top Cards)
📊 Feasibility Score (0–100)

🗺️ Zoning Type (e.g., Residential - Yellow Zone)

⚠️ Major Obstacle (e.g., Greenbelt + no conversion)

🧭 Recommendation: ✅ Proceed / ⚠️ Risky / ❌ Reject

📐 2. Area Breakdown Panel
A donut chart or table showing:

🟨 Undeclared or disputed zones

Also shows:

Original extent vs. Net usable for layouting

Minimum % needed for profitable layout (from ROI logic)

🧭 3. Zoning & Conversion Logic Viewer
Text + visual:

Current Zoning (from CDP 2031): Residential / Industrial / Greenbelt / Mixed

Conversion Order (if any): shows order number, match with CDP?

🔁 Mismatch Highlight: “CDP shows Greenbelt, but conversion is residential — risky.”

🧰 4. Access & Infrastructure Check
Checklist with ✅ or ❌ indicators:

Road access (within 100m)

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — this screen is especially useful for transparency, debugging, and AI audit. Here's the plan for:

🟥 Screen 7 – Multi-Agent Logs & Debug Console
🎯 Purpose
Give power users, devs, or compliance reviewers full visibility into:

What AI agents were triggered

What data they used

What outputs they produced

Where failures or warnings occurred

This also doubles as a debug panel during manual override or white-label QA.

🧠 1. Agent Execution Timeline (Top Section)
Horizontal log of steps (visual timeline or table):
Time	Agent	Status	Summary
09:12	Feasibility Agent	✅ Completed	Score: 83 – Green Zone, Converted
09:13	Red Flag Agent	⚠️ Warning	Kharab mismatch – flagged
09:14	Compliance Agent	✅ Clean	EC + Mutation verified
09:15	Valuation Predictor	✅	₹2250–₹2450/sqft band
09:16	Layout Suggestion Agent	❌ Error	Drain access missing – layout not generated

🔘 Filter by status: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌
🔘 Sort by agent type or time
🔘 Expand row for deep logs

📄 2. Agent Deep Logs Panel (Expandable View)
Each agent opens a collapsible block:

Allows superusers to:

Modify land unit fields temporarily

Re-run individual agents (e.g., only Compliance Agent)

Simulate different scenarios (e.g., zoning = Mixed instead of Residential)

✅ Audit log tracks all manual interventions

🧠 4. AI Stack Summary Footer
Quick summary of:

Number of agents run

Confidence range per agent (optional)

Internal version of each agent (for bug traceability)
